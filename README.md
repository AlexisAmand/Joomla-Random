A small PHP script that allows you to display a random article from your Joomla blog

I recommend using the random.php file that uses the joomla api. The randomsansapi.php file retrieves the information in the configuration file, it works and gives the same result, but it's less fun. Of course, you can rename the file if you feel like it. You just have to remember to leave the extension ".php".

This is the first time I use the Joomla! API.

According to the tests I have done so far, the script works with version 3.9 but not with version 1.5 of Joomla.

How does it work ?
------------------

Just download the random.php file, and put it at the root of your Joomla installation. 
For example : www.monsitehypercool.com/joomla/ (don't click it's just an example)

Demo

This script is in demo on my personal website (Joomla 3.9) at the following address. It's a bit like Russian roulette, either you stumble upon a very cool article, or you stumble upon a bad one.
